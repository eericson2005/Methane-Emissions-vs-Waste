<h2>Description</h2>
This project investigates the connection between methane emissions, municipal waste, and population to derive waste management solutions to high methane emissions. It was my first full experiment as a data scientist and the first team project of my freshman year. These factors resulted in a challenging yet rewarding experience as my group worked through our research.<br/>
<br/>
Due to my groups nascency in programming, we opted to perform our exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Microsoft Excel rather than in Visual Studio. Additionally, in an effort to meet the time constraints of the project, we chose to narrow our analysis to four nations: Germany, Indonesia, China, and the United States. We assigned one person to each country, and I chose to research our three variables of interest in China.<br/>
<br/>
The excel sheets we used to search for correlations can be accessed within the README, with the customized sheets representing the areas where we did all of our EDA. A PowerPoint and a formal report are also included in the README to summarize our teams methods and findings.<br/>
